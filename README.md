# 100daysofcode
Dr Angela Yu's 100 days of code challenge, I am gonna try to finish this course.
Also , I strongly believe if can complete it, I will be in completely different level in coding.
Since I want to be a data scientist, I will study math as well as coding in this duration.
I'd also like to say that I will also work on PostgreSQL during this whole process. 

So, let the party beginn.
